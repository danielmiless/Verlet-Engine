# Verlet Engine

This is a simple 2D Verlet physics engine designed for simulating classical free-body and multi-body systems, including chains. It utilizes efficient low-order Verlet integration combined with a sub-framing technique to produce realistic real-time mechanics.

## Features

- **Realistic Simulations:** The engine is capable of simulating classical physics with realistic mechanics in 2D space.
- **Free-Body and Multi-Body Systems:** Simulate individual particles or create complex multi-body systems such as chains.
- **Efficient Verlet Integration:** Utilizes a low-order Verlet integration algorithm for efficient and stable simulations.
- **Sub-Framing Technique:** Incorporates a sub-framing technique to enhance the accuracy of real-time mechanics.
